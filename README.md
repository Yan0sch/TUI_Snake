# Snake
This is a simple snake game without a graphical user interface. It only uses the terminal and the ANSI escape codes. (see [ANSI escape code - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)).

The default area is 20 rows and 40 columns so make sure yout have enough space in your terminal.

You have to install the keyboard package separately:
`pip3 install keyboard`
